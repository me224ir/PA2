# Programming assignment 2

To use database correctly, open the whole folder (if you do not already have a folder, move 'sql.py', 'lessor1.csv', 'universities1.csv' and 'cities1.csv' into the same folder and open that folder) in an editor like Atom or Visual Studio Code and it will make a database for you with the given data when run. 

First time running it will create the database for you, you will then need to rerun it to make use of the database.

If there are any troubles with the queries choose "3" in the start-up menu to delete the database and retry by rerunning the program.
